This is a Python library imitating Django's lazy QuerySet API.

For details of APIs inspiring this project, see:
 - http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/
 - http://haystacksearch.org/docs/searchqueryset_api.html

This code currently has status of a toy project.  For documentation,
read the documentation strings and supplied unit tests.  Providing
anything more would be promising too much :)
